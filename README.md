# Winamp Snap

This is the snap for [Winamp](https://www.winamp.com/). It works on Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and other major Linux distributions.

This Windows application runs on Linux using the Wine compatibility layer. For that reason, it may not function as expected. If you encounter issues please report in the issue tracker of this repository.
